# Git-Followers-iOS-App

# Overview:

This project is intentionally open-ended. We want to see you create when it’s all up to you. The project will be assessed on your code quality, UI/UX, and overall quality and feel of the app.



# App Premise:

- The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
- The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
- The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower. 
- The user is able to save favorite username searches so they don’t have to type them every time. This needs to persist between app launches.



# Requirements:

- 100% programmatic UI - No Storyboard
- No 3rd Party Libraries



# Details:

- Use the GitHub API - No authentication needed 
    - Followers endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/followers/
    - User info endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/
- When showing more information about a user, what information you display is up to you. If you were creating this product, what information do you think users want to see?



# Design:

- We want to see what kind of design you come up with. We don’t expect you to be a professional designer, but we believe our developers should have rudamentary design knowledge.
